      Since June 2023, I've been actively involved in volunteering at the SPCA. I dedicate my time on a monthly basis, 
      engaging in various tasks such as cleaning the cat enclosures and dog kennels, spending quality playtime with the furballs, 
      ensuring they are well-fed, and occasionally interacting with potential adopters.

      I've recently picked up photography as a hobby, with a particular interest in street and architectural photography.
      Every now and then, I like to stroll around Singapore with my trusty Nikon D3100, capturing interesting sights along the way.
