        Photoasis is an online photo gallery that allows you to upload your photos along with their EXIF data (camera settings, such as ISO and Aperture values). 
        Photography is my hobby, and analyzing and comparing my photos with their camera settings has enabled me to improve my skills in properly exposing photos 
        and capturing better shots. Hence, I designed Photoasis as a platform to document my growth in photography as well as a place to archive my most precious moments in life.

        Todo lists serve as a reminder to the users the tasks that they have to complete. 
        However, users have to remember to add these tasks into the list of todos in the first place. 
        If they have forgotten to do so, these tasks will not appear in the todo list, 
        and they may end up forgetting about these tasks altogether.

        Odo.t is an online todo-list where todos can be automatically added at every fixed interval (e.g. every day, every week). 
        Users only have to set the interval once, and the todo list becomes automated! 
        Odo.t also features a set of basic todo list functionalities such as sorting the tasks, grouping tasks together and marking certain tasks as important.
